=====================
  Todo
=====================
1. Init a symbol
2. Download the full history of a pair
3. Download the full history of many pairs
4. Download the partial history of a pair
5. Notify


-- Strategy algorithm --
. initialize all pairs
. once all pairs have been initialized
  a. Launch the listener 'thread'
  b. Start fetching the history of each pair (queue based, single fetch thread?)
. once we have ENOUGH data, start Analyzing it
  a. EMA50
  b. VixFix
  c. Direction
. after a candle has been analyzed, check if it's a buy / sell or ignore
. notify the trader
. check the current volume of the market
. negotiate to find a position size
. open position
. set HARD SL
. configure Soft SL, and Trailing SL activation point
. keep listening to the market

=====================
  Backlog
=====================
. Launch thread that listens to the market

. Store new candles in a 'mem-db'
. When a new candle arrives, try to analyze it (and other data without ta)
. If there is not enough information, return

. Launch a process that fetches previous information
. Parallel fetch
. Generate a unique id (maybe divide time frame)
. if we are asking TOO MUCH info to binance, wait a little

. Calculate EMA50
. Calculate VixFix
. Enter positions
. Track positions
. Set SL Immediately

=====================
  Ideas
=====================
. Process that analyzes the market and finds 'good coins'
. Real time visualization of EVERYTHING
. Real time client for candles
  . Publish the new data in a socket or something ??

  Done
