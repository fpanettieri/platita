=====================
  Todo
=====================
. 




. Launch thread that listens to the market

. Store new candles in a 'mem-db'
. When a new candle arrives, try to analyze it (and other data without ta)
. If there is not enough information, return

. Launch a process that fetches previous information
. Parallel fetch
. Generate a unique id (maybe divide time frame)
. if we are asking TOO MUCH info to binance, wait a little

. Calculate EMA50
. Calculate VixFix
. Enter positions
. Track positions
. Set SL Immediately


=====================
  Ideas
=====================
. Process that analyzes the market and finds 'good coins'
. Real time visualization of EVERYTHING
. Real time client for candles
  . Publish the new data in a socket or something ??


=====================
  Done
